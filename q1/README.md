## Development Environment:

    Compiler: GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)
    Operating System: Windows 10

### Steps to Compile and Run the Source Code:
1. Compile the code using the GCC compiler with the following command:
```bash
gcc -o q1 q1.c
```
This command will generate an executable file named "q1.exe" in the same directory.

2. Run the program by executing the following command:

```bash
./q2
```

*Note: Make sure you have GCC installed on your system and added to the system's PATH environment variable to successfully compile and run the C code.*
